## 📝 Important Notes

### **Streaming URLs:**
- Movies must be added to the database with `wootly_url` or `dood_url` to enable streaming
- If a movie is not in the database, the player will show "No Stream Available"
- You can add streaming URLs via Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/

### **Series Episodes:**
- Series, seasons, and episodes must be added to the database to display
- The API fetches series metadata from TMDB but episodes from the database
- Use Django Admin to add seasons and episodes for each series

### **Adding Content via Django Admin:**

**To add a movie with streaming:**
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Click "Movies" → "Add Movie"
3. Fill in the TMDB ID (will auto-fetch details)
4. Add `wootly_url` and/or `dood_url`
5. Save

**To add series episodes:**
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Click "Series" → Select a series
3. Add seasons with season numbers
4. For each season, add episodes with episode numbers
5. Episodes will automatically appear organized by season
